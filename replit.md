### Storage Implementation
The application includes both memory-based storage (for development) and database storage interfaces, allowing for flexible deployment scenarios.

## Data Flow

1. **Lead Entry**: Users input lead data through forms or file uploads
2. **Processing**: Server validates and stores lead data in PostgreSQL
3. **Analytics**: Statistics are calculated on-demand from stored lead data
4. **Reporting**: Charts and reports are generated using Chart.js on the frontend
5. **Export**: Data can be exported in multiple formats for external use

## External Dependencies

### UI and Visualization
- Radix UI primitives for accessible component foundation
- Chart.js for data visualization
- Lucide React for consistent iconography
- Date-fns for date manipulation

### Data Processing
- XLSX for Excel file processing
- PapaParse for CSV parsing
- Zod for runtime type validation
- Drizzle Zod for schema-to-validation integration

### Development Tools
- Replit-specific plugins for development environment integration
- TypeScript for type safety across the entire stack
- ESLint configuration for code quality

## Deployment Strategy

### Development
- Vite dev server serves the React application
- tsx runs the Express server with hot reloading
- Drizzle Kit handles database migrations
- Environment variables manage database connection

### Production
- Vite builds the frontend to static assets
- esbuild bundles the backend into a single file
- Static files are served by Express
- PostgreSQL database runs on Neon serverless platform

### Environment Configuration
- Database URL configured via environment variables
- Separate configurations for development and production
- Session storage integrated with PostgreSQL for scalability

The application is designed to be easily deployable on platforms like Replit while maintaining the flexibility to deploy elsewhere with minimal configuration changes.
