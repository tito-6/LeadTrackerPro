🚀 PROMPT: Advanced Lead Data Parsing, Reporting, and Analysis for Real Estate Lead Reporter App
📥 1. WebForm Notu Parsing for Lead Type & Project Detection
After importing the Excel/CSV/JSON file, the system must automatically:

Detect if the lead is Kiralık (Renting) or Satılık (Sales) by scanning the content of:

nginx
Copy
Edit
WebForm Notu
Examples to detect:

Contains: Kiralık → mark as "Renting"

Contains: Satılık → mark as "Sales"

Missing or unclear → mark as “Bilinmeyen” (Unknown)

Detect and assign Project Name from same WebForm Notu field, by capturing strings such as:

“Model Sanayi Merkezi”

“Model Kuyum Merkezi”

Any text after last / in line

This parsed data must be used across the entire app in:

Charts

Reports tab

Genel Görünüm tab

Salesperson sub-tabs

Filtering options

⚠️ 2. Detect and Visualize Duplicated Entries
A duplicate is identified when:

Müşteri ID or İletişim ID is repeated

System must:

Highlight duplicates in a separate table

Show duplicate summary in the Reports tab and Overview

Chart showing the ratio of duplicates over total leads

Provide option to filter, edit or delete duplicates manually

📊 3. Individual Salesperson Reports with Charts
Each salesperson's report (in their tab) must include:

Total leads assigned

Status distribution chart (based on SON GORUSME SONUCU)

Copy
Edit

Reflect the data with:

A 3D pie chart or bar chart
