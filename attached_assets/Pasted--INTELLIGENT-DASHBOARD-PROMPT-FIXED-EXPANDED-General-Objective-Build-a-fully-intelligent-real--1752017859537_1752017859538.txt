 INTELLIGENT DASHBOARD PROMPT (FIXED & EXPANDED)
General Objective:
Build a fully intelligent, real-time updating lead performance dashboard that:

Accepts two file uploads:

The main lead file (including all general details).

A second “takipte” file (like the one provided in JSON format), which must be uploaded after the first and provides extra context.

Both must merge automatically and reflect insights across all tabs.

🔄 Import & Data Parsing
The system must automatically parse and detect:

Date fields in any format (e.g., DD.MM.YYYY, YYYY-MM-DD, MM/DD/YYYY) and use them for dynamic date filtering.

Lead status from the "SON GÖRÜŞME SONUCU" column. Do not label empty statuses as "Yeni"—they must reflect as "Boş" or be excluded until assigned.

Lead type (Satılık, Kiralık) and project name (e.g., Model Sanayi Merkezi, Model Kuyum Merkezi, etc.) from WebForm Notu using pattern matching (/ Ilgilendigi Gayrimenkul Tipi :...).

Duplicate leads based on name, phone number, or identical note data — and show them in visual charts + a dedicated “Duplicate Leads” tab.

📊 Dashboard & Reporting Features
1. Genel Görünüm Tab
Charts here must reflect all lead statuses accurately.

Charts must support 3D pie, column, and line views, switchable via dropdown.

Every chart must show:

Left-side written breakdown of each slice or bar: category, count, and percentage.

Visual breakdown of total lead status, project type, and assigned salespeople.

2. Personel Performans Tablosu
Must dynamically update based on uploaded data.

Must reflect all statuses from "SON GÖRÜŞME SONUCU" and group them correctly.

Data should match Genel Görünüm charts.

Display an additional 3D pie or bar chart showing total leads assigned per salesperson (including 0 values).

3. Olumsuz Analizi Tab
Automatically extract reasons from "Dönüş Olumsuzluk Nedeni" column.

Group charts by distinct reasons (e.g., “Yanlış Numara”, “Bütçe Yetersiz”, etc.).

Display interactive filters to switch between reason groups.

Include trend insights over time: How often each reason occurs per salesperson or project.

4. Takip Raporu Tab
Must reflect data from the second imported JSON file.

Currently showing nothing — fix this.

Detect columns from file like SONUÇ, GÖRÜŞME, GÖRÜŞME TARİHİ, etc.

Show filtered statuses such as:

“Arandı - Geri Dönecek”

“Ulaşılamıyor”

“Takip Edilecek”

Must group and visualize these by salesperson, project, and week/month.

🛠 Settings Panel Requirements
Allow users to:

Change chart colors based on:

Status

Lead type

Salesperson

Choose chart types (3D pie, bar, line, donut, etc.)

Re-label empty statuses or value placeholders

💾 Editability & Reusability
After upload, users must:

See all imported data in editable format (table view).

Edit any cell, and changes must immediately reflect across all dashboards and charts.

💡 Innovation Requirement
Provide the world’s smartest and most actionable dashboard:

Show which project and salesperson combinations are underperforming.

Display which reasons are trending for failure or success.

Provide proactive alerts: “This project has 70% unsold leads,” etc.

Allow hover-over insights and exporting PDF snapshots of each section.
