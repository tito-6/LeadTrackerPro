ULTIMATE UI/UX CHART & REPORTING UPGRADE PROMPT – Lead Reporter App
✨ Transform the Genel Görünüm (Overview) and Raporlar (Reports) tabs into powerful, interactive, visually rich reporting dashboards that fully reflect the imported data and meet the following criteria:

📊 1. Toplam Lead - Durum Dağılımı (Total Lead Status Distribution) Chart
Must reflect the exact same data as the “Raporlar” tab.

Based on the column:

nginx
Copy
Edit
SON GORUSME SONUCU
Group all unique statuses (e.g., “Satış Yapıldı”, “Olumsuz”, “Bilgi Verildi”) with dynamic counts.

Use 3D Pie Chart style by default.

Add toggle button to switch chart type between:

🥧 Pie (3D)

📊 Column Bar Chart

📈 Line Chart

👨‍💼 2. Personel Performans Tablosu (Personnel Performance Table)
Data must match 100% with reports under “Raporlar” tab.

Based on:

Atanan Personel

SON GORUSME SONUCU

Filterable by Talep Geliş Tarihi

Each row must include:

Personnel name

Count of leads by status (colored cells like in Excel)

Progress bar (% of monthly sales goal reached)

Auto-updating monthly target (e.g., 1 sale per month, adjusted by date range)

Charts reflecting each salesperson’s performance

🧠 3. New Chart: Total Leads by Salesperson
A new chart must be added to both Genel Görünüm and Raporlar:

Data source: Atanan Personel

Chart must:

Reflect each salesperson’s share of the total leads

Work even if someone has 0 leads (must show empty slice/bar with 0%)

Have a label with both absolute count and percentage

Chart Type Switcher: Allow user to toggle between:

Pie (3D)

Donut

Column

Line

🛠️ 4. Cool Factor & Interaction
All charts must support:

Hover effects with details (tooltip showing count, percentage, etc.)

Click-to-filter (clicking a salesperson filters the table to show only their leads)

Smooth transitions between chart types

Add animation when data changes or filters are applied (make the UI fun and modern)

Respect dark/light mode switch

🧪 5. Ensure Sync Between Tabs
Any data in Genel Görünüm (Overview tab) must be 100% in sync with:

Filters applied in the Reports tab

Data imported and parsed

No mismatch in lead status counts, charts, or personnel metrics
