Unified Visual Consistency
Genel Görünüm tab and Salesperson Report Screens (e.g., Alperen Yerlikaya) must show the same charts and data panels.

Satış Temsilcisi Performans Raporları must reflect the exact same analytics and design structure from the main dashboard, including full visual breakdowns of sales/rental statuses, project filters, and lead types.

📁 Import & File Management
The system currently does not allow uploading of the second file for Takip Analizi.

A proper import option for the Takipte file must be added.

To fully generate a valid report, two files must be uploaded:

Main Leads File (includes statuses, sources, etc.)

Takipte File (includes follow-up details like "Hatırlatma", "Puan", "Konuşma Süresi", etc.)

The system must intelligently detect column names dynamically from these files and adjust filters, charts, and analysis logic accordingly.

📊 Chart and Analysis Improvements
All charts (including in Genel Görünüm, Olumsuz Analizi, and Takip Analizi) must support:

3D views

Ability to switch between Pie, Column, and Line charts

Custom color assignments for each lead status, person, office, and customer situation from a unified Settings Panel.

🧠 Smart Data Visualization
Charts in Genel Görünüm are too small and text is unreadable. They must be responsive and full-width for optimal readability.

Kaynak Analizi (Source Analysis) and Gelişmiş Analiz (Advanced Insights) must be implemented as new tabs or widgets using:

Data from the "İrtibat Müşteri Kaynağı" (Instagram, Facebook, 444 74 13, etc.)

"Görüşme Tipi" (e.g., Giden Arama, Yeni Gelen Arama, Kendisi Geldi)

"Ofis" column (e.g., İkitelli, Kapaklı)

"Meslek Adı" column (e.g., Sanayici)

📞 Takip Analizi Redesign
Merge the "Takipte Analizi" tab with 📞 Takip Raporu into one unified tab.

In Takipte section, group and display by:

"Kriter" field (e.g., Satış Müşterisi, Kira Müşterisi)

"İrtibat Müşteri Kaynağı"

"Görüşme Tipi"

"Ofis"

"Meslek Adı"

"Hatırlatma Tarihi" and "Hatırlatma Var Mı" (e.g., show reminders due)

"Konuşma Süresi" and "Puan" (e.g., performance scoring dashboard)

👥 Personel Atama ve Durum Özeti
Must show ALL lead statuses from the imported file.

Must be filtered by project, source, and lead type dynamically.

Should reflect real-time personnel assignments and statuses.

Hide any salesperson not present in the imported data file.

❗ UI/UX Fixes in Olumsuz Analizi
Olumsuz Analizi > Pasta Grafik (Pie Chart) UI is broken: labels overlap, are unreadable, and chart spacing needs fixing.

Group olumsuz leads based on reason and allow toggling between groups (e.g., Gerekiyorsa Kendisi Arayacak, Yanlış Numara, Bütçe Yetersiz).

🧰 Settings Overhaul
Merge all settings tabs into a single "Ayarlar" page.

Allow custom color assignments for:

Lead statuses

Personnel

Source types

Follow-up statuses

Allow selection of default chart styles per tab (Pie, Column, Line).
